        <h1>Learn All About Me!</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Janett Ramirez, and I am a senior in college. I currently attend the 
        University of Puget Sound in Tacoma. I am majoring in Mathematics with minors in 
        Computer Science, Latino/a Studies, and Spanish. </p>

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>In my family I am the middle child. I have an older brother and a younger brother. 
        Five years ago we added a new member to our family, our dog Cruiser. Cruiser is a 20 pound Shih Tzu
        with a tan fur coat. My family and I have been living in the state of Washington for 22 years now, 
        however, my parents grew up in MÃ©xico and moved to the US at a young age.
