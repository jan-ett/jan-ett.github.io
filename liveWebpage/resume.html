        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p><em>University of Puget Sound, Tacoma, WA</em><br>
        Bachelor of Mathematics, Computer Science Minor, Latino/a Studies Minor, and Spanish Minor<br>
        August 2018 - May 2022</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p><em>University of Puget Sound, Math Tutor, Tacoma, WA</em><br>
        As a Math Tutor for the Deparment of Mathematics for the University of Puget Sound, 
        I was able to tutor students taking the Calculus sequence. Students taking Calc I, Calc II, 
        and Multivariate Calculus were able to come to the tutoring center with questions about 
        homework or exams for different concepts being taught in their classrooms. Working with 
        different students allowed me to develop various approaches to fit the student's learning 
        needs.</p>
        <p><em>University of Puget Sound, Math Grader, Tacoma, WA</em><br>
        As a Math Grader for the Deparment of Mathematics at the University of Puget Sound 
        I was assigned to grade for a MATH 280 Multivariate course. Each week Each week I go 
        through homework assignments from 30 students and grade selected problems. This work 
        allows me to see how each student approaches the homework problems and demonstrate that 
        there are multiple ways to solve the same problem.</p>

        <h2>Coursework</h2>

        </p>

        <h2>Technical Projects</h2>
        <p><em>Tweet Processor, CSCI 161</em><br>
        In this Tweet Processor homework assignment I was asked to create code that would 
        take a given tweet from a user and report how many mentions hashtags, tweets, terms, 
        and characters used per tweet. This code also has a feature that allows the user to print 
        a summary of the number of times each tracked items appears in the tweet.</p>
        <p><em>Black Jack Game, CSCI 161</em><br>
        In this homework assignment I was tasked with created an interactive game of Black Jack. 
        The game uses a scanner to prompt the user for their choice of move. Additionlly, 
        once the game is over, the user is able to view both their hand and the AI's hand. 
        The user will also be alerted if they have won or lost.</p>
        <p><em>Ranked Choice Vote, CSCI 261</em><br>
        This homework assigment simulated a real election where ballots are counted and the lowest 
        ranked candidate is removed until the winner is selected by majority vote. This code uses a 
        scanner to read incoming ballots and determine the winning candidate. This code also 
        includes arraylists and hashmaps.</p>
