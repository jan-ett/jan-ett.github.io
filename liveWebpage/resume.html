        <h1>Education</h1>
        <p><em>University of Puget Sound, Tacoma, WA</em><br>
        Bachelor of Mathematics, Computer Science Minor, Latino/a Studies Minor, and Spanish Minor<br>
        August 2018 - May 2022</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p><em>University of Puget Sound, Math Tutor, Tacoma, WA</em><br>
        As a Math Tutor for the Deparment of Mathematics for the University of Puget Sound, 
        I was able to tutor students taking the Calculus sequence. Students taking Calc I, Calc II, 
        and Multivariate Calculus were able to come to the tutoring center with questions about 
        homework or exams for different concepts being taught in their classrooms. Working with 
        different students allowed me to develop various approaches to fit the student's learning 
        needs.</p>
        <p><em>University of Puget Sound, Math Grader, Tacoma, WA</em><br>
        As a Math Grader for the Deparment of Mathematics at the University of Puget Sound 
        I was assigned to grade for a MATH 280 Multivariate course. Each week Each week I go 
        through homework assignments from 30 students and grade selected problems. This work 
        allows me to see how each student approaches the homework problems and demonstrate that 
        there are multiple ways to solve the same problem.</p>
