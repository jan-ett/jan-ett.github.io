        <h1>Learn All About Me!</h1>
        <p>Hello! My name is Janett Ramirez, and I am a senior in college. I currently attend the 
        University of Puget Sound in Tacoma. I am majoring in Mathematics with minors in 
        Computer Science, Latino/a Studies, and Spanish. </p>

        <h2>Family</h2>
        <p>In my family I am the middle child. I have an older brother and a younger brother. 
        Five years ago we added a new member to our family, our dog Cruiser. Cruiser is a 20 pound Shih Tzu
        with a tan fur coat. My family and I have been living in the state of Washington for 22 years now, 
        however, my parents grew up in MÃ©xico and moved to the US at a young age.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Some of my favorite things to do outside of school include reading, playing volleyball, 
        watching any new release from Marvel, and finding new music to listen to. I started playing 
        volleyball in Middle School and continued to play for the next 6 years for in school and on 
        a club team. During my freshman year at UPS I also joined the intramural volleyball team!
        It wasn't until just two years ago when I first began watching the Marvel movies and was
        instantly hooked. I recently watched "Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings" in theaters. 
        Lastly, I am always looking for new music suggestiongs to expand my library!</p>
